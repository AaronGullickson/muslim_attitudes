\section*{Abstract}
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Despite widespread scholarly interest in values and attitudes among Muslim populations, relatively little work has focused on specific attitudes popularly thought to indicate anti-modern or anti-liberal tendencies within Islam. In this article, we use data from the Pew Research Center from 2008-2012 to examine support for violent practices among Muslims in thirty-five countries. Support for violent practices is defined by three questions on the acceptability of killing apostates, the stoning of adulterers, and severe corporal punishment for thieves. Using multilevel models that capture country-level variability, we analyze the relationship between support for violent practices and education, religiosity, and development. In general, we find that support for violent practices is less common among individuals with more education and less religiosity and who come from more developed countries. However, when we examine variation across countries, we see evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the association of education and religiosity with support for violent practices. We find that education \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and religiosity are less liberalizing in less liberal countries }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is more liberalizing in more liberal countries and in less developed countries. The effects of religiosity are also related to country-level context but vary depending on how religiosity is measured}\DIFaddend . \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Furthermore, there is no association between the effects of education and religiosity within a country. We discuss the implications
of these findings more broadly based on prior work on liberal value
systems in mostly Western countries. }\DIFdelend Overall, the variation we observe across countries calls into question a civilizational approach to studying values among Muslim populations and points to a more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{nuanced
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{detailed }\DIFaddend multiple modernities approach.

\section*{Introduction}

In a viral appearance on the HBO Show ``Real Time with Bill Maher'' in 2014, actor Ben Affleck became embroiled in an unexpected debate with host Bill Maher and fellow guest, Sam Harris, over the allegedly authoritarian and violent tendencies of Islamic doctrine \cite{casey_real_2014}. Harris, one of the leading figures in the New Atheist movement, argued that Islam ``at this moment is the motherlode of bad ideas.'' To support this view, Maher offered data from a recent poll of Muslims worldwide conducted by the Pew Research Center which showed that ``like 90\%'' of Egyptian Muslims supported death as a punishment for leaving the faith.

Although Maher's figure was factually correct, the statistic is nonetheless misleading. Egyptian Muslims were more supportive of this statement than Muslims in any other country in the Pew study. In contrast, only 0.8\% of Muslims in Kazakhstan felt similarly. Among the more than thirty countries in the cited Pew survey as well as a similar one conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, the level of support among Muslims for killing apostates varies uniformly between these two extremes. Substantial variation rather than strict orthodoxy is the key to understanding Muslim responses to this question. For social scientists, this variation then begs a further question - why do Muslims vary so much in their support for such ``bad'' ideas?

In this article, we take up this question with a more formal analysis of the Pew data. The data were collected between 2008-12 on Muslims in thirty-five countries representing roughly sixty-five percent of the global Muslim population. From this data, we develop a value construct measuring support for violent practices from three questions on the acceptability of killing apostates, the stoning of adulterers, and severe corporal punishment for thieves. Following prior work on the impact of modernization and development on liberal values in mostly Western contexts, our analysis focuses on the relationship between this value construct, education, religiosity, and development.

Our analysis builds on an extensive literature on values and attitude among Muslims, and complements prior research in two important ways. First, we address specific attitudes that have never been examined in scholarly work, despite their prominence in popular discussions of Islam in the West. Most prior research focuses either on attitudes regarding universalistic and abstract concepts such as support for democracy, political violence, and gender equality, or relies upon large aggregate indices that are driven by a multitude of specific attitudes ranging from acceptance of abortion to whether respondents would be willing to sign a petition \cite{inglehart_worldviews_2007}.

A focus on universalistic attitudes, however, provides little insight into the specific attitudes and values that differentiate cultural and religious groups. For example, whether a respondent is willing to sign a petition or is supportive of democracy in the abstract may tell us little to nothing about how that respondent feels toward the mandate that apostates should be killed. Yet, the justifiability of killing apostates is a topic that both divides Muslims internally and distinguishes Muslims from other religious groups. It is not simply that Muslims feel differently on this issue in comparison to other religious groups, but rather that the question itself is only intelligible among Muslims.

Second, the large sample of countries here allows us to more systematically examine country-level variation than has been possible in much of the prior work on value systems in Muslim populations. While \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proponents of }\DIFaddend classic modernization theory expected a fairly uniform pattern of modernization, contemporary scholars expect greater heterogeneity in this process \cite{eisenstadt_civilizational_2001}. Some have even suggested that change in cultural systems -- including values and attitudes -- may be largely unconnected to processes of modernization and development \cite{huntington_clash_1996}. To better understand this heterogeneity, we use multilevel models that provide information about country-level variation in support for violent practices and country-level variation in the association between support for violent practices and education and religiosity. We argue that the pattern of variation at the country level provides insight into the role of educational and religious institutions in the process of value change.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In summary, our analysis is guided by the following research questions:
}

\begin{enumerate}
%DIF > \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
%DIF > \tightlist
\item
  \DIFadd{What is the relationship between support for violent practices and education, religiosity, and level of development across all countries?
}\item
  \DIFadd{How does the level of development in a country affect the relationship between support for violent practices and education/religiosity?
}\item
  \DIFadd{How is the average level of support for violence in a country associated with the relationship to education/religiosity in that country?
}\item
  \DIFadd{How are the country-specific effects of education and religiosity on support for violent practices associated with one another?
}\end{enumerate}

\DIFaddend When we pool results across countries, our analysis \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{largely }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{somewhat }\DIFaddend supports the expectations of modernization theory. Support for violent practices is less common among individuals with more education and less religiosity and who come from more developed countries. However, when we examine variation across countries, we see evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the effects of education and religiosity on support for violent practices \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. In both cases, we find that the association between
education/religiosity is less liberalizing in countries that are more supportive of violent practices overall, suggesting that the role of
educational and religious institutions shifts with changes in the larger
society. Furthermore, we find little association between the effects for

institutions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{respond to the social context of the country in important, but also sometimes unexpected, ways}\DIFaddend .

\section*{Background}

Prior work on values and attitudes in Muslim populations has focused on a variety of such attitudes including support for democracy \cite{jamal_attitudes_2008, ciftci_modernization_2010, ciftci_secularislamist_2013}, political violence\cite{mousseau_urban_2011, berger_foreign_2014}, women's rights \cite{inglehart_true_2003}, and fundamentalism \cite{moaddel_religious_2018}. While a summary of this work is beyond the scope of this article, such studies are often framed around modernization theory and its closely related cousin, secularization theory, as well as critiques of these theories \cite{jamal_reassessing_2006, moaddel_introduction_2007, ciftci_modernization_2010}.

Modernization theory treats cultural and value change as largely a by-product of structural development \cite{lerner_passing_1958, parsons_social_1964, inkeles_becoming_1974}. Industrialization and economic growth bring about \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{higher educational attainment, }\DIFaddend greater differentiation in the occupational workforce, urbanization, and higher standards of living \cite{rostow_stages_1960}. All of these factors contribute to a shift from conservative and authoritarian values to liberal values that promote individual autonomy and self-determination \cite{parsons_social_1964}. Concomitantly, rationalization, individualism, and cultural pluralism reduce the significance of religious institutions in favor of secular institutions, diminishing the role of religion in social life \cite{wilson_religion_1966, bruce_secularization_2011, emerson_rise_2006}.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{From the basic expectation of modernization theory, we develop our first hypothesis:
}

\begin{quote}
\emph{\DIFadd{H1:}} \DIFadd{The level of development in a country is negatively associated with support for violent practices.
}\end{quote}

\DIFadd{While classic modernization theorists have viewed modernization as a fundamental process that would evolve similarly across countries, many scholars today criticize this view for privileging the historical experience of the West as a universal model. These ``multiple modernities'' scholars argue that while modernity will likely lead to changes in social and cultural systems, these changes will materialize in multiple dissimilar and non-convergent forms because countries develop within various historical and cultural contexts \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{hefner_multiple_1998, eisenstadt_multiple_2000, kamali_multiple_2006, casanova_cosmopolitanism_2011}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}

\DIFadd{In this }\DIFaddend article, we focus on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{two important themes within this
framework. First, scholars often treat }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the role that such heterogeneity may play in the association between support for violent practices and individual level variables across countries. Specifically, we look at the role of }\DIFaddend education and religiosity \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on value change, because these two variables are seen }\DIFaddend as key variables \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at the individual level connected }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that connect individual-level practices }\DIFaddend to processes of modernization and value change \cite{scheepers_education_2002}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Second,
contemporary critiques of modernization theory have often pointed to the heterogeneity and variation in the experience of development across
countries rather than its uniformity and standardization
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{smith_future_2008}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The effects of these variables also inform us more broadly about the role of educational and religious institutions in value change}\DIFaddend .

\subsection*{The role of education and religiosity \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on values}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in value change}\DIFaddend }

Education is often seen as a crucial fulcrum at the individual level for processes of modernization \cite{meyer_effects_1977, chabbott_development_2000, depaepe_educationalization_2008}. In terms of value change, research has repeatedly shown that education is positively related to liberal values \cite{hyman_education_1979, bobo_education_1989, weakliem_effects_2002, kingston_why_2003}.

While these results are broadly consistent with modernization theory, significant debate has persisted on how to understand this finding. The development perspective\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, often tied to modernization theory, }\DIFaddend holds that education is linked to fundamental cognitive changes in the way people view the world that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{leads }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{lead }\DIFaddend to more tolerance and less authoritarianism \cite{adorno_authoritarian_1950, mcclosky_dimensions_1983}. On the other hand, the socialization perspective argues that educational institutions socialize individuals to the prevailing norms of a society \cite{selznick_tenacity_1969, jackman_education_1984, phelan_education_1995}. Therefore, the liberalizing effects of education will only exist in countries where liberal values are commonplace. Consistent with the socialization perspective, cross-national results in Western countries show that the positive effect of education is greatest in countries with more liberal values overall \cite{weil_variable_1985}.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{From these arguments, we develop several hypotheses relating to the effects of education. First, the development perspective would expect education to have a similarly negative effect on support for violent practices across countries. Thus:
}

\begin{quote}
\emph{\DIFadd{H2a:}} \DIFadd{The association between education and support for violent practices is consistently negative across countries.
}\end{quote}

\DIFadd{A less stringent version of this hypothesis would expect that the liberalizing effects of education are most substantial in countries that have developed a modern educational system. Thus, we should expect the negative effect of education to be the greatest in countries with the highest level of development:
}

\begin{quote}
\emph{\DIFadd{H2b:}} \DIFadd{The association between education and support for violent practices is more negative in countries with higher levels of development.
}\end{quote}

\DIFadd{Alternatively, the socialization perspective would expect that the effect of education will be the most negative in countries where support for violent practices is low and the negative effect of education will be weaker or even reverse direction in countries where support for violent practices is high. Thus:
}

\begin{quote}
\emph{\DIFadd{H2c}}\DIFadd{: The association between education and support for violent practices is positively correlated with overall support for violent practices in a country.
}\end{quote}

\DIFadd{Finally, according to Huntington's civilizational argument, Western liberal traditions are not intrinsic to the process of modernity but rather a specific inheritance of Western civilization \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{huntington_clash_1996}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Thus, we should not expect to see education operate in a similar fashion outside of Western contexts. Specifically, Huntington argued that the primary agents for the contemporary rise of Islamic fundamentalism were an urban and educated middle class \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{huntington_clash_1996}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Rapid economic growth and urbanization dislocate individuals from traditional structures of social support and this dislocation is experienced most intensely by upwardly mobile, young, urban, and educated individuals. Therefore, contrary to research primarily in Western contexts showing a liberalizing effect of education, Huntington expected the reverse in Muslim societies. Thus:

\DIFaddend Social scientists have often treated religiosity as the anti-modern counterweight to education \cite{schwadel_explaining_2015}. High levels of religiosity are seen to indicate commitments to conservative and authoritarian values \cite{rokeach_part_1969, rokeach_part_1969a, wilcox_evangelicals_1990}. Although there is significant heterogeneity across countries, research has shown that religious identification tends to be associated with support for right-wing parties and more conservative attitudes \cite{wilcox_evangelicals_1990, kelley_class_1995, scheepers_religion_1998, karpov_religiosity_2002, norris_sacred_2011}.

\DIFaddend Although less widely acknowledged than for the case of education, the effect of religiosity may similarly be mediated by the role that religious institutions play as socialization agents \cite{scheepers_education_2002}. In particular, religious institutions may respond to the prevailing norms and beliefs in a society in one of two ways. Greater liberalism within a society may dampen the conservative effect of religiosity on liberal values or it may alternatively provoke a greater defense of religious values and increase the association between religiosity and conservative values \cite{kelley_national_1997}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We therefore consider two hypotheses about the role that overall support for violent practices may play in the relationship between religiosity and that support.

\section*{\DIFadd{Analytical approach}}

\DIFadd{To test the hypotheses outlined above, we developed a multilevel model using the Pew data detailed below. }\DIFaddend Specifically, we use a random intercept and random slope multilevel model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend in which the intercepts and the slopes for the educational attainment and religiosity variables are allowed to vary across countries. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Multilevel models estimate country-specific parameters using partial pooling between the global estimate and fixed-effects country-specific estimates, which avoids overfitting the data and produces more reasonable estimates \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{gelman_multilevel_2006}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}

\DIFaddend Our general model specification is:

\[y_{ij}=\beta_{0j}+\beta_{1j}(\texttt{religiosity}_{ij})+\beta_{2j}(\texttt{education}_{ij})+\sum_{k=1}^K \lambda_kx_{ijk}+\epsilon_{ij}\]

where \(y_{ij}\) is the score on the measure of support for violent practices (detailed below) for the \(i\)th respondent in the \(j\)th country. The intercept \(\beta_{0j}\), and the two slopes of \(\beta_{1j}\) and \(\beta_{2j}\) on religiosity and education, respectively, are allowed to vary by country. The model also includes \(K\) additional independent control variables \(x_{ijk}\) that are not allowed to vary by country. \(\epsilon_{ij}\) is an individual-level error term.

To complete the multilevel model structure, the three country-varying parameters have their own linear equations:

\[\beta_{0j}=\gamma_{01}+\gamma_{02}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend \texttt{development}_j\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend +\delta_j\]
\[\beta_{1j}=\gamma_{11}+\gamma_{12}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend \texttt{development}_j\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend +\eta_j\]
\[\beta_{2j}=\gamma_{21}+\gamma_{22}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend \texttt{development}_j\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend +\tau_j\]

The structure shown here is for the fullest model in which we include a country-level measure of development (detailed below) that predicts the intercept and the two slopes. The \(\gamma_{02}\) term measures the association between development and average support for violent practices in a country\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which directly addresses }\emph{\DIFadd{H1}}\DIFaddend . The \(\gamma_{12}\) and \(\gamma_{22}\) terms measure how development in a country affects the individual-level relationship between support for violent practices and either education or religiosity, respectively. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These terms allows us to test }\emph{\DIFadd{H2b}} \DIFadd{and }\emph{\DIFadd{H3b}}\DIFadd{.
}\DIFaddend 

The error terms \(\delta_j\), \(\eta_j\) and \(\tau_j\) are country-level random effects that measure country-level heterogeneity in terms of the intercept and two slopes. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Because the correlation of these
random effects is important for our understanding of this heterogeneity
across countries, we place no restrictions on the correlation between
these error terms in the estimation of the model.

\DIFdel{Given the model outlined above, we develop several expectations about
the estimates it will produce. These expectations relate to several

educational attainment (\(\gamma_{21}\)) across countries. Modernization

(\(\tau_j\)) is correlated with the overall average level of support for
violent practices within that country(\(\delta_j\)). These correlations
tell us the degree to which these associations increase or decrease with
the overall sentiment of the country. They therefore offer a test of the
socialization hypothesis which would expect a positive correlation. If
this is the case, it suggests that educational and religious
institutions move in step with popular attitudes.

possibilities for this correlation. If the correlation is positive, then
we observe a process of synchronicity in which educational and religious

Alternatively, if the correlation is negative, then we
observe a process of polarization between education and religious

\section*{Materials and methods}

Data for this analysis come primarily from two cross-national surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center's Religion and Public Life project. The first survey, \emph{Tolerance and Tension: Islam and Christianity in Sub-Saharan Africa}, sampled more than 25,000 respondents in nineteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa in 2008-2009. The second survey, \emph{The World's Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society}, sampled more than 30,000 Muslim respondents in twenty-six countries throughout the world in 2011-2012. The questionnaires for the surveys are very similar, although additional questions were added and some other questions were re-worded in the second survey. We focus our analysis only on questions that are consistent across both surveys.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In both data sources, respondents were 
fully anonymized prior to our access.
}\DIFdelend 

We combine Muslim respondents from these surveys together to construct our full analytical dataset. Five sub-Saharan African countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Botswana, Rwanda, South Africa, and Zambia) were excluded from analysis because of minuscule (2\% or less) Muslim populations. Four other countries were excluded because key questions for the analysis were not asked in those countries (Iran, Morocco, Mozambique, and Uzbekistan). Finally, Thailand was excluded because the sample was not nationally representative. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Fig~\ref{fig1} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure \ref{fig:figure-world-map} }\DIFaddend shows a map of the countries included in our analysis with shading by the percent Muslim in each country. The countries in the sample cover all regions of the world with substantial Muslim populations. In total, we use data from 35 countries and 35,400 respondents. The average sample size per country was 1,011 respondents with a minimum size of 245 respondents in Cameroon and a maximum size of 1,918 respondents in Bangladesh.

\end{figure}

Because the country-level surveys were designed to be nationally representative, the data should be representative of within-country populations, but not necessarily the global Muslim population. Collectively, the countries in the sample roughly account for sixty-five percent of the global Muslim population \cite{pewforumonreligionandpubliclife_global_2012}, but some important countries both symbolically (e.g.~Saudi Arabia, Iran) and by population weight (e.g.~India) are absent.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Several variables used in this analysisare }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For the dependent variable and several other variables in the analysis, we considered }\DIFaddend constructs made up of multiple individual items\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, including the dependent variable and the

.

\cite{gadermann_estimating_2012}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD

. Because frequentist test statistics are likely to identify even trivial deviations from invariance in a sample this large \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite[p.~106]{vandevijver_methods_2021}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, we use the Bayesian Information Criterion to evaluate IRT models that test sequentially for metric and scalar invariance}\DIFaddend .

\subsection*{Measuring support for violent practices}

We develop our measures of support for violent practices based on multiple questions that were fielded in both surveys. Respondents were asked yes/no questions for whether they favored (a) the death penalty for people who leave Islam, (b) harsh punishments like whipping and cutting off hands for crimes like theft and robbery, and (c) stoning people who committed adultery. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These three measures were highly
correlated with one another (Cronbach's \(\alpha=0.83\)) and exploratory
factor analysis indicated that a single scale worked well for all three
variables. }\DIFdelend We also considered a likert-scale question on the justifiability of violence against civilians in defense of religion, but this variable had a much weaker correlation with the three other measures and so we dropped it from analysis. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We constructed the dependent variable for our models by counting the number of favorable responses to each of the remaining questions and then re-scaling this tally to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Fig~\ref{fig2} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure \ref{fig:country-averages} }\DIFaddend shows the average level of support by country for the three items that make up our measure of support for violent practices. Countries tend to have similar levels of support for all items within the construct, but the variation across countries is substantial. Support for these values ranges from virtually no support in countries such as Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan to nearly universal support in countries such as Afghanistan and Egypt.

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Globally, these three measures were highly correlated with one another (\(\alpha=0.93\)) and exploratory factor analysis indicated that a single scale worked well for all three variables. At the country level, \(\alpha\) was above the standard cutoff for good reliability of 0.7 for all countries except for Jordan and Egypt, which still had reasonable \(\alpha\) values of 0.68 and 0.62, respectively.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{When testing for measurement invariance, we found some evidence of metric invariance. After analyzing model fit, we found that this metric invariance was caused by low correlations between the death for apostasy variable and the other two variables in Egypt and Jordan. Removing either of these countries led to a model fit that supported metric invariance. Figure \ref{fig:country-averages} shows that the ordering of overall support for each item is different in Egypt and Jordan than in the remaining countries. In Egypt and Jordan, respondents were substantially more supportive of death for apostasy than the other two measures, whereas in the remaining countries, this item typically has similar or lower support. These results suggests that as support for this item approaches universality in these countries, its correlation with remaining items declines.  Previous work has noted that this issue is a common problem in analyzing measurement invariance when group-level item means vary across the entire range of the distribution \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{welzel_noninvariance_2021}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. We have decided to retain Egypt and Jordan in the full analysis, but some caution should be taken in interpreting the specific results for these countries.
}

\DIFadd{Further tests indicated scalar invariance in this measure. Scalar invariance is an extremely common issue in cross-national research \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{meitinger_measurement_2020}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, but the literature currently offers little guidance in how to resolve such problems. While scalar invariance technically indicates that means across groups are not directly comparable, it may in some cases have a minimal impact on such comparisons. As a sensitivity test, we estimated separate multilevel logit models on each of the items within the construct and compared the fixed and random components of each model to one another and to the model using the construct itself. Overall, both the fixed and random components are highly consistent across all models and none of our substantial conclusions would be modified by use of the separate models. Importantly, the random intercepts across the separate logit models (which measure the mean value in a country) are highly correlated (\(r>=0.92\)) with the random intercepts of the construct model in all three cases. Therefore, on the principle of parsimony, we use the construct-based model for the remainder of the analysis here. The results of the sensitivity analysis are provided in the supplementary materials.
}

\DIFaddend \subsection*{Measuring development}

At the country-level, we considered two different possibilities for a measure of overall development. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is often used as a purely economic measure of the level of development. On the other hand, the Human Development Index (HDI), produced by the United Nations Development Program, offers a more holistic measure of development. The HDI considers three separate components in its overall measure: life expectancy at birth, overall educational attainment, and gross national income per capita. These three components are combined into a single composite index.

These two measures are highly correlated among the countries used in the analysis (\(r=0.78\)). All models reported here use the HDI. We chose the HDI as our primary measure of development because it allows us to parsimoniously capture \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mutiple }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{multiple }\DIFaddend dimensions of development. As a sensitivity analysis, we constructed identical models with a logged GDP per capita measure. The results were similar, although the logged GDP variable tended to produce slightly smaller overall effects than HDI. The models from this sensitivity analysis are available in the \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \nameref{S1_Appendix}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{supplementary materials}\DIFaddend .

\subsection*{Independent variables}

Education is a key measure in our analysis, but the categories used for educational attainment are country-specific, making it challenging to include in a cross-national analysis. Educational attainment was reported as a three-category system for the sub-Saharan African countries and relative to country-specific educational systems for the remaining countries. These country-specific systems ranged from a high of twelve distinct categories to a low of five distinct categories. We harmonized these measures by creating a quantile score based on the distribution of the educational attainment variable within each country. Each respondent was assigned a midpoint value on the quantile score between their given level of education and the next lowest level (or zero when the respondent was in the lowest category). This quantile score measures a respondent's relative position on the distribution of education within a country. We also considered a three-category measure of absolute educational attainment consisting of no secondary education, at least some secondary education, and post-secondary education that could be used for all countries. Sensitivity tests showed that these models produced similar results, but the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{BIC }\DIFdelend model fit statistics strongly preferred the educational quantile measure. Full results are available in the \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \nameref{S1_Appendix}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{supplementary materials}\DIFaddend .

We measure each respondent's religiosity using a concept that combines the experiential and ritualistic dimensions of Glock and Stark's framework \cite{glock_religion_1965}. Our goal is to isolate the importance of religion in a person's daily life as measured by their personal experience and practice of it from specific ideological beliefs and knowledge about the religion. We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{measure religiosity with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{considered }\DIFaddend a three-item construct including a question on the importance of religion in a person's life, the frequency of mosque attendance, and the frequency of prayer. Across the entire sample, this three item construct had a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Cronbach's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reasonable }\DIFaddend \(\alpha\) of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.68. Mosque attendance has been
criticized by some scholars as an inappropriate Western import for measuring religiosity among Muslims \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{el-menouar_five_2014}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.78. }\DIFaddend However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sensitivity tests suggested that mosque attendance had similar
effects on outcomes as other measures of religiosity when we examined
the separate effect of each variable and we therefore retain it.
These
results are available in the }%DIFDELCMD < \nameref{S1_Appendix}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{country-level \(\alpha\) values for this religiosity construct varied considerably and fourteen countries had an \(\alpha\) below 0.6. Therefore, we decided to include each of the three variables measuring religiosity separately into the models. As the results below will show, each variable had a similar average effect on the outcome variable, but the pattern of random country-level slopes was substantially different for each variable}\DIFaddend .

Prior research has shown that religiosity is positively associated with theological literalism, conservativism, and fundamentalism among Muslims \cite{moaddel_religious_2018}. Individuals with more literal and theologically conservative beliefs are likely to have more anti-liberal values simply because some of the measures used for the dependent variable can be argued to have scriptural justification. To control for this potential confounding influence in our analysis, we tested a separate construct that measured theological conservatism and literalism in a person's actual beliefs. We considered questions on whether a person must believe in god to be moral, whether Islam is the one true faith, and whether there was only one way to interpret religious teachings. However, these questions did not hold up well as a single construct (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Cronbach's \(\alpha=0.38\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(\alpha=0.56\)}\DIFaddend ). Therefore, to capture theologically conservative beliefs and practices, we included all three questions as separate independent variables in our models.

We include a variety of other individual-level variables in all models. We include variables for the age (five-year brackets), gender, income, and urbanicity of the respondent. Income was reported in loosely defined quartiles (i.e.~four categories from ``low'' to ``high'') for the sub-Saharan African countries and brackets that were specific to each national currency for remaining countries and so we use a method identical to that for education to create income quantile scores. The country-specific income brackets ranged from a high of seventeen \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distinct }\DIFdelend categories to a low of five \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distinct brackets}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{categories}\DIFaddend .

We also include a measure of the respondent's self-reported denomination. The primary division here is between Sunni and Shia, but many respondents also identified in a non-denominational way (e.g.~``just a Muslim'') which we retain as a separate category. We combine all other denominations into a single ``other'' category. A separate item asked respondents whether they identified with any Sufi orders. We code this \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{response }\DIFaddend as a binary variable that is distinct from the denominational categories.

We also control for non-religious ideological views. We constructed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an
index }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{two indices }\DIFaddend of socially conservative views based on the respondent's answers regarding the acceptability of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{seven stigmatized behaviors(drinking
alcohol, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{several stigmatized behaviors. Exploratory factor analysis suggested that the best fit was provided by a two factor solution that divided the items into those associated with death (}\DIFaddend euthanasia, suicide, abortion\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, prostitution, premarital sex, and homosexuality; Cronbach's \(\alpha=0.76\)). We also combine }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; \(\alpha=0.82\)) and those associated with sex (prostitution, homosexuality, and premarital sex; \(\alpha=0.88\)). This two factor solution also was metrically invariant across countries, although not scalar invariant. We also include }\DIFaddend two questions that gauge respondents' attitudes toward Western movies, music, and television\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{into an anti-Westernization scale}\DIFdelend . Finally, we include questions on whether religion is in conflict with modernity, and whether the country would be better off with a strong leader rather than a democratic government.

\subsection*{Multiple imputation}

We use multiple imputation to address missing values in the dataset. We imputed five complete datasets using multivariate imputation by chained equations \cite{buuren_mice_2011}. We generally did not impute values when a question was missing because it was not asked in a particular country, but we made two exceptions to this rule. Questions regarding the moral acceptability of prostitution, premarital sex, and homosexuality were not asked in Afghanistan and the two questions about the morality of western movies, music, and television were not asked in Lebanon. In both of these cases, we imputed values in order to maximize country sample size. The percentage of values imputed ranged from a high of 11.4\% for the question on whether religion was in conflict with modernity to 0.7\% for the respondent's age. We included dependent variables in the imputation procedure, but drop cases that were missing on the dependent variable. After this exclusion, the sample size of our \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{anlalytical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{analytical }\DIFaddend dataset is 31,528 respondents.

\subsection*{Scaling variables}

To facilitate comparisons between variables in the models, all quantitative variables have been re-centered on the mean and re-scaled. The dependent variable has been divided by its standard deviation. Independent variables have been divided by twice their standard deviation. The estimated effects of quantitative variables shown throughout this article can be interpreted as the expected change in standard deviations of the dependent variable for an increase of two standard deviations in the independent variable. Dividing by twice the standard deviation makes the slopes of quantitative variables in linear models roughly comparable to the effects of categorical dummy variables \cite{gelman_scaling_2008}.

\section*{Results}

Table \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~\ref{tab1} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{tab:model-table} }\DIFaddend shows the results of three multilevel models predicting support for violent practices. Model 1 includes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{only individual level variables}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{all independent variables, but no interaction term}\DIFaddend . Model 2 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{adds in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{interacts }\DIFaddend the country-level \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Human Development Indicator (HDI ) as a predictor of average support for violent practices in a country.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The individual-level }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{All of the independent }\DIFaddend variables are highly consistent across models. Although we focus primarily on the effects of education\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and religiosity, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, religiosity, and development, }\DIFaddend we first briefly summarize the effects of other variables on support for violent practices. Income has little effect on support for violent practices. Similarly, we observe no difference between men and women in support for violent practices. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Age differences are relatively small and
do not demonstrate a consistent trend when comparing younger to older
respondents. Rather, the results suggest specific cohort effects where
the cohorts between ages 35-44 and 50-59 are less }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Differences across age generally show that the youngest cohorts (under age 35) are more }\DIFaddend supportive of violent practices than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{adjacent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{older }\DIFaddend cohorts. Urban residents are less likely to support violent practices than those in rural areas. In terms of denomination, Sunnis are the most supportive of violent practices and Shias the least supportive, with other denominations and ``just a Muslim'' respondents falling in between. Self-identifying as a member of a Sufi order is associated with greater support for violent practices. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{All of the variables measuring theological conservatism are positively
associated with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Theological conservatism is generally associated with greater }\DIFaddend support for violent practices\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, but the strongest effect among these items is the belief that Islam is the one true faith}\DIFaddend . Respondents with more anti-Western views were also more supportive of violent practices.

\DIFdel{Religiosity is more strongly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Social conservatism is not positively }\DIFaddend associated with support for violent practices\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{than any of the other individual-level independent variables.

\DIFadd{The three measures of religiosity are all strongly positively correlated with }\DIFaddend support for violent practices\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scale, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. In fact, frequency of prayer had the strongest association with support for violent practices among the individual-level variables and the other two measures of religiosity also exhibited some of the strongest associations. This strong association is observed }\DIFaddend even when holding constant a variety of demographic and ideational variables. On average, across countries, Muslims who are more religiously observant and devout are more likely to support violent practices and this result is not simply a function of demography, theological conservatism, social conservatism, or anti-Western sentiment.

The education quantile measure has a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{smaller }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{substantial }\DIFaddend negative association with support for violent practices\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, but the magnitude here is much smaller than for the religiosity variables}\DIFaddend . A two standard deviation increase in the education quantile is associated with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a 0.062 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{roughly a 0.06 }\DIFaddend standard deviation reduction in the support for violent practices scale. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The results are inconsistent with the expectations of Huntington expressed in }\emph{\DIFadd{H2d}}\DIFadd{.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Model 2 introduces }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The results for }\DIFaddend the HDI measure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as a predictor of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in Model 1 also shows that the level of development in a country is strongly negatively associated with }\DIFaddend support for violent practices \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. This country-level predictor has the largest association of
any term in the model}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in that country}\DIFaddend . A two standard deviation increase in the HDI is associated with a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.417 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.330 }\DIFaddend standard deviation decrease in a country's average on the support for violent practices scale. Individuals from more developed countries are much less supportive of violent practices, on average\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, as expected by }\emph{\DIFadd{H1}}\DIFaddend .

In Model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2}\DIFaddend , we allow for an interaction between HDI and our measures of religiosity and education. Effectively, we are allowing the association between religiosity/education and support for violent practices to vary by the level of HDI\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, as predicted by }\emph{\DIFadd{H2b}} \DIFadd{and }\emph{\DIFadd{H3b}}\DIFaddend . There is little evidence of variation in the effect of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{religiosity by HDI. However, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{any of the religiosity variables by HDI, casting doubt on }\emph{\DIFadd{H3b}}\DIFadd{.

increases. However, the effect is so large that ``flattening'' does not
adequately account for the strengh of this interaction term. In countries that have HDI one standard deviation higher than the mean, the model expects the association to reverse directionand become positive. Thus, education is expected to be positively associated with support for
violent practices in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{becomes weaker in more developed countries, rather than stronger. In }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{most developed countries}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{most developed countries, the education association may even reverse direction}\DIFaddend . \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{While this result is not statistically significant in Model 2, Model 3 shows that the lack of significance is due to multicollinearity problems in Model 2 that inflated the standard error.
}\DIFaddend 

We now turn to the random country effects estimated by the models. The variance and correlation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these country effects is shown at the bottom
of Table ~\ref{tab1}. The association between religiosity and support for violent practices is slightly more variable across countriesthan the

\DIFadd{To explore this variation in more detail, we plot the random slopes for all countries in Figure \ref{fig:random-slope-lollipop}. This figure clearly shows the substantial variation in the effects of these variables across countries. As expected, the religiosity slopes are positive and the education slopes are negative for most countries. However, we do observe a small number of countries with estimated slopes in the opposite direction for all four variables. The number of countries with negative slopes for mosque attendance and frequency of prayer is small and the magnitude of these negative slopes is small. For the question on whether religion is important, we see more negative effects and a few (Kenya, Niger, Guinea-Bissau, and Kosovo) that are more substantial in magnitude. In these countries, individuals for whom religion is more important are less supportive of violent practices.

\DIFaddend \section*{Conclusion}

In this article, we have analyzed variation in support for violent practices among Muslims in thirty-five countries, paying particular attention to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effects }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{association }\DIFaddend of education, religiosity, and development \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with }\DIFaddend these attitudes, as well as the heterogeneity in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effects }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this association }\DIFaddend across countries.

At first glance, the results \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are largely consistent with prior research
and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{seem consistent with }\DIFaddend the expectations of modernization theory. Greater development in a country, as measured by the Human Development Index, strongly predicted less support for violent practices. Similarly, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{when averaged across countries, }\DIFaddend the effects of education and religiosity are as expected from prior research in predominantly non-Muslim contexts\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, when averaged across countries}\DIFdelend . More educated individuals are moderately less \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{likely to support }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{supportive of }\DIFaddend violent practices while individuals with greater religiosity are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{much more likely to
support }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{substantially more supportive of }\DIFaddend violent practices. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The association between religiosity and support for violent practices
was stronger than any other individual-level variable used in the
analysis. Importantly}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Furthermore}\DIFaddend , this religiosity \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effect is not simply a surrogate
for theological conservatism or literalism. We found that while measures
of theological conservatism also predicted greater support for violent
practices, the religiosity }\DIFdelend association remains strong even after controlling for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these variables, as well as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{theological conservatism and }\DIFaddend a variety of other ideational variables.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Looking beyond the average effects across countries toward country-level
heterogeneity , the results suggest a more complex and nuanced
assessment. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, modernization theory is not supported when we look more closely at the heterogeneity in the }\DIFaddend effects of education and religiosity \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on support for violent practices across countries. Both of these effects }\DIFaddend were highly variable across countries. In a minority of countries, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{education
predicts more, rather than less, support for violent practices .
Similarly, in some countries there was virtually no correlation between religiosity }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the expected relationships were even reversed.
}

\DIFadd{Furthermore, the association between education and violent practices deviated from the expectations of modernization theory in two ways. First, we found that the negative relationship between education }\DIFaddend and support for violent practices \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. While we may observe
tendencies in terms of the effects of educational and religious
institutions on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is weakest (and may even change direction) in the most developed countries rather than the least developed countries. Second, we found that the association between education and }\DIFaddend support for violent practices \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, these effects are far
from uniform and may be strongly affected by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is the most negative when countries have less overall support for violent practices. This latter finding is more consistent with the socialization hypothesis than the development hypothesis in accounting for the relationship between education and liberal values. In short, we find no evidence of a universally consistent effect of education on values, but rather one mediated by social context.
}

\DIFadd{The results for religiosity are somewhat more complex, owing to the fact that the patterns of }\DIFaddend country-level \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{heterogeneity. In the context of the strong effect of religiosity on support for violent practices, the heterogeneity observed here
demonstrates that there is no necessary connection between religiosityand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{heterogeneity were different across the three variables we used to measure religiosity. The positive association of frequency of prayer with }\DIFaddend support for violent practices \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was reduced in countries with less overall support for violent practices, suggesting that this form of religiosity was affected by socialization in a manner similar to education}\DIFaddend . \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{How can we make sense of this variation in the effects of education and
religiosity across countries ? Some of this variation may reflect
idiosyncratic, historical, and path-dependent processes that are not
easily amenable to a quantitative analysis. }\DIFdelend However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we did explore two
possibilities with regard to this variation. First, we find that the within-country association for both education and religiosity is
positively correlated with the average }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the other two measures of religiosity were not strongly associated with the overall }\DIFaddend level of support for violent practices in a country. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In the case of education, Education exerts the strongest negative effect }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We also found that, for all three variables, the effect of religiosity }\DIFaddend on support for violent practices \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in countries
with the lowest average level of support overall while education has
little effect or even a positive association in countries with the most
support for violent practices overall. Religiosity has the strongest
positive effect on support for violent practices in countries with the
most support overall, and religiosity has the weakest positive effect in
countries where support for violent practices is the lowest overall.
Both findings are consistent with the socialization hypothesis, which
argues that social institutions often reflect rather than drive changes
in attitudes and values. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Second, we include the level of development as a predictor of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was not associated with the level of development in }\DIFaddend the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{country. Overall, religiosity seems considerably less responsive to social context than education, but this depends somewhat on which aspect of religiosity we choose to focus on.
}

\DIFadd{We also explored how the variation in country-level education and religiosity effects might be related to one another. We identified strong correlations between these effects, but we again found that the results varied by which measure of religiosity we examined. The effects of mosque attendance and the importance or religion were strongly negatively associated with the effects of education. These results suggest polarization between educational and religious institutions within countries. Countries with the most negative }\DIFaddend association between education \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/religiosity }\DIFdelend and support for violent practices \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. We find some evidence that the negative relationship between education }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tend to have the most positive association between mosque attendance/importance of religion }\DIFaddend and support for violent practices\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is weaker in more developed
countries.
This may reflect a ``flattening'' process whereby greater
development universalizes liberal values and leads to less cleavage
between educational groups. We find little evidence of an effect of
development on the association with religiosity.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{As a further check on what is driving country-level heterogeneity, we examined the correlation between }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Interestingly, we found an opposite pattern of synchronization in the strong positive association between education effects and }\DIFaddend the effects of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{religiosity and
education across countries. Somewhat surprisingly, there is very little
correlation in the effects of these two variables across countries. This
implies that there is not necessarily a greater singular force
(e.g.~``modernization'') driving change in both religious and
educational institutions, but rather that these two institutions are
affected disparately by factors unique to each country}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{frequency of prayer. In this case, countries with the most negative association between education and support for violent practices tend to also have the least positive (and occasionally negative) association between frequency of prayer and support for violent practices. These results suggest that this particular form of religiosity is more amenable to a softening influence in the face of larger social change}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Overall, the }\DIFaddend heterogeneity we observe across countries \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{places our results
somewhere between classic modernization theory and multiple modernities.
If classic modernization theory is seen as a tendency rather than a
rule, our results could be considered as an accurate reflection of its
expectations. Similarly, our results could also be seen as empirical
evidence in support of a multiple modernities approach by showing just
how different the process of modernization can be for some countries.
Nonetheless, the strong aggregate tendency toward the expectations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the effects of education and religiosity casts doubt on the universalistic assumptions }\DIFaddend of classic modernization theory\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{calls into question an unconstrained
version of the multiple modernities approach. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. }\DIFaddend This heterogeneity also casts doubt on the utility of the civilizational argument to understand value change. We find no evidence of a singular civilizational pattern of Islamic societies. Rather, we find that the general patterns of Islamic ``civilization'' are consistent with those observed in non-Islamic societies but with substantial variation at the country level.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This variation cannot be explained by what is held
constant, namely Islam.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Instead, our results support a multiple modernities perspective and a socialization perspective. Social institutions respond differently to social change in different ways across countries and this produces heterogeneity in effects across countries. Some of this heterogeneity we can account for by observable social context, such as the overall level of development and overall support for violent practices. However, much of this variation remains unaccounted for and would need to be explored by a more detailed comparative analysis of the historical development of each country.
}

\DIFadd{To highlight this last point, }\DIFaddend We draw attention to the results for Algeria and Tunisia\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to highlight this issue}\DIFdelend . Algeria and Tunisia are arguably two of the most similar countries in our dataset by geography, language, and culture. Yet, the observed relationships between education and support for violent practices are not only opposite in these two countries, but represent two of the most extreme values in the data. In Tunisia, educational attainment strongly predicts less support for violent practices, while in Algeria, educational attainment strongly predicts greater support for violent practices. The implication is that we must delve deeper into the particular historical development of each country in order to understand this variation.

We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{focus in this article on whether the observed patterns in the data
are consistent with the expectations of prior theory and have attempted
to avoid the use of strong causal language throughout.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{draw two additional implications from our results that are relevant for related research. First, the heterogeneity across countries suggests that quantitative analysis of values and attitudes among Muslims using a small set of countries can easily draw misleading results depending on which countries are selected. Much of the prior research on this topic uses samples of five or fewer countries. Attempts to generalize from such samples to the global Muslim population may be suspect.
}

\DIFadd{Second, the effects of religiosity on attitudes may depend on which measures one employs. We found very different patterns across the three measures of religiosity we used here and also detected issues of unreliability and invariance when trying to develop a construct from these measures. Prior work often relies on a single measure and this may mislead researchers about the potentially variable effects of different elements of religiosity.
}

\DIFadd{Our results are not without their own weaknesses. }\DIFaddend Strong causal claims are limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data. For example, while we find that Muslims in countries with greater development tend to have less support for violent practices, we cannot show that a change in development is associated with a weakening of those attitudes. Future longitudinal data would be valuable at strengthening our understanding of causal mechanisms, albeit difficult and costly to obtain on a sample of this size and scale.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Furthermore, although our sample of countries is quite large, it is still a non-random sample and could potentially misrepresent global patterns. In particular, our sample is missing two countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are symbolically very important in discussions of Islamic civilization.
}

\DIFaddend The goal of this article has been to use statistical analysis to leverage a large dataset and provide a birds-eye view of the relationship between support for violent practices and individual and country-level predictors. By necessity, this approach ignores the specificity and nuance of country-specific historical development. Our intent is not to discount or replace work that focuses on particular historical cases or small N comparative/historical analyses, but rather to complement this work with a broader comparative approach. Indeed one of the central findings of our analysis is the substantial variation in key relationships between countries. This suggests the possibility of fruitful explorations at the country-level using multiple methodological approaches to understand the substantial heterogeneity documented here.
